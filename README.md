# RPS-game

This rock, paper, scissors game was initially played entirely in console.

I practiced branching to create a user interface feature and later updated that UI to improve underlying features.

This has minimal CSS and HTML and is mostly run in JavaScript. This runs well on desktop and mobile and has been entirely removed from the console to be played in the UI.

This was completed as part of The Odin Project.
